      "My current major research project, the Baudelaire Song Project  (baudelairesong.org,  @BaudelaireProj) has one main aim: to research all the song settings ever of the poems by famous French poet Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867). Working with Dr Mylène Dubiau at the University of Toulouse II, and the HRI Digital team at the University of Sheffield, we are building a pioneering digital dataset which brings together for the first time both pop music and classical music settings of Baudelaire's verse and prose poetry.",
      "Using innovative digital song analysis techniques devised and tested by our project Research Associate Dr Caroline Ardrey, we are able to produce rich, comparative data across a wide dataset, meaning we can answer questions such as: What are the performance trends in singing Baudelaire's poems? Which poems are never or rarely set to music, and why? How do composers and songwriters handle the challenges of setting French verse metre? Are there certain types of musical genres which are more suited to Baudelaire's poetry than others? The project is generously funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) 2015-2019.",
      "Related to this project, my most recent monograph, Baudelaire In Song 1880-1930 ( 2017/18) sets out a new methodology for analysing song settings of poetry. It takes five European song sets as its case studies from French, Russian, and Austrian composers of the fin-de-siècle/early 20th century, and reveals how understanding song means understanding the complex, multi-layered bonds that form and shape it.",
      "Drawing on existing theories from translation, adaptation, and word-music studies, it critiques and enriches these perspectives by exploiting recent neuroscientific research and developing new digital approaches for analysing song.",
      "My inaugural lecture at the University of Birmingham on 17 November 2017 on the topic of 'Baudelaire in Song' is available to watch online.",
      "Beyond the Baudelaire Song Project, my broader research areas include:",
      "Rhetoric, poetics, music and aesthetics 1850–1950, with particular emphasis on theories of voice",
      "Post-romantic French poetry, and in particular Baudelaire, Gautier, Mallarmé, Villiers de l’Isle-Adam, Verlaine, Valéry, and Post-romantic French song, and in particular Berlioz, Charpentier, Debussy, Duparc, Fauré, Vierne",
      "Aesthetic theory and neuroscience 1880–present (in particular the work of René Ghil, Jacques Rancière, and neuroscientific theories of ‘pre-movement’ and resource-sharing)",
      "Influence of French symbolist poetics on early twentieth-century Italian poetry (in particular the poetry of Dino Campana, Eugenio Montale and Gabriele D’Annunzio)",
      "Central to my approach is working regularly with practitioners (songwriters, composers, singers, pianists, performers, actors). Current and recent collaborations, and events include:",

Her research explores the basis of action in human rights. Her doctoral thesis unpacks the function of anti-colonial resistance and social movements in shaping human rights ideals and offers a psycho-social examination of the concept of resistance in human rights.",
      "Shaimaa has taken on a few research projects that build on her doctoral thesis. Her research fellowship at the Hague Academy of International Law examined the implications of centering a human rights response to COVID-19. She deploys a counter-narrative to the exceptional framing of the pandemic and questions global health governance regimes that reproduce a stratifying hierarchy between first world and third world societies.",
      "Shaimaa also maintains an active interest in third world approaches to international law (TWAIL), postcolonial legal theory, feminist legal thought and black studies. During her research fellowship at Melbourne Law School, she examined practices of sovereign recognition in the League of Nations in relation to shaping postcolonial agencies.",
      "Currently, Shaimaa is working on the significance of black and Islamic feminist thought in challenging the securitisation of gender struggles in human rights. Her research is part of a broader project on Feminist Collaborative Ethos in International Law."

      "My research interests are primarily in the area of early modern English literature (1500-1800), particularly religious poetry and prose; the works of John Donne and John Milton; textual editing; and the history of the book (including the history of reading, book collecting, and textual transmission). I am also interested in applications of computational linguistics to literary criticism (especially of early modern English prose), and in genetic criticism (tracing the stages of composition). Selected works and works-in-progress that incorporate a number of these interests include: two monographs, John Donne's Books: Reading, Writing, and the Uses of Knowledge (forthcoming) and Penelope Fitzgerald (2018); co-editorship of The Oxford Handbook of the Early Modern Sermon (Oxford, 2011); and volume editor (Vol. 2) of The Oxford Edition of the Sermons of John Donne.",

      "Since 2008 I have been co-convenor, first with Professor Tom Corns and latterly with Professor Sarah Knight, of the British Milton Seminar, held twice yearly in Birmingham. I am also a member of the Standing Committee of the International Milton Symposium. Between 2007 and 2012, I was the co-founder and organiser (with Dr Mary Morrissey) of the Sermons Studies Network (with over 150 scholars as members). The network held its inaugural colloquium in November 2007 on the topic of 'Uses of Secular Language in Early Modern Preaching', and two further one-day conferences at the Universities of Birmingham and Reading, on the subjects of 'Regional and Parochial Preaching' (2009), and 'King David' (2010)."

      "Mitochondrial diseases are some of the most common inherited metabolic disorders. They typically arise from primary defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), affecting tissues with high energetic demand such as the brain, liver and cardiac and skeletal muscle. However, their presentation is not uniform between patients or between organs, with the same monogenic mutation resulting in pathologies as diverse as severe multisystem disorder or mild adult-onset muscle weakness. Why this is the case is still poorly understood. At the moment there are no effective treatment options for any of these devastating diseases.",
      "Recent discoveries have established ferroptosis as a potential contributor in mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial OXPHOS defects impair cellular redox balance and metabolic fitness, and can render different tissues susceptible to ferroptosis. Mitochondrial stress signalling cascades provide protection against ferroptosis and are emerging as important adaptive, prosurvival mechanisms.",
      "My research aims to characterise the tissue specific stress signaling in mitochondrial dysfunction and study the metabolic outcome and pro-survival function of these stress responses. I am currently using different tissue specific cell culture models as well as in vivo models to better understand the disease mechanisms in mitochondrial diseases with the ultimate goal to develop new therapy options for the patients."

      "I am a historian of race, migration and empire. My first book Exhibiting Irishness: Empire, Race and Identity, 1850s to 1960s (Manchester, 2024) traces multiple constructions of Irish identity in national and international displays as Ireland moved from a colonial to an independent, globally-connected state. As a cultural history of Irish identity, the book considers exhibitions as a formative platform for imagining a host of Irish pasts, presents and futures. I have formerly worked at the Royal Historical Society to improve BME representation in UK History, whether working with schools and the curriculum, cultural institutions, community groups or other learned societies. I have also worked closely with museums and heritage sites as a researcher and consultant on shaping histories of the British Empire for today’s populace. Overall, I am committed to researching histories of race, migration and empire and thinking through their presentation in historic or contemporary visual platforms."

This relies upon pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the kinetic plasma physics of resonant interactions between charged particles and electromagnetic waves. This research direction has evolved from a longstanding interest in kinetic plasma physics.",

      "Caroline’s research focuses on nineteenth-century French literature, in particular poetry, and its intersections with other art forms. She is especially interested studying the links which poetry during this period had with musical culture, fashion and social life.",
      "Her doctoral thesis looked in particular at the work of the nineteenth-century French poet, Stéphane Mallarmé, who published a fashion magazine, entitled La Dernière Mode during the second half of 1874. Caroline’s thesis argues that 1874 and, more specifically, the eight issues of La Dernière Mode represent a turning point in Mallarmé’s aesthetic. Through a comparative study of the text and typographical conventions in the fashion magazine and in Mallarmé’s theoretical writings and notes, she makes a case for seeing La Dernière Mode as a testing ground for some of the key principles which form Mallarmé’s ideal book, known as the Livre.",
      "Caroline’s current research is linked to her work as part of The Baudelaire Song Project, focusing in particular on popular song settings and appropriations of Baudelaire’s poetry. She is especially interested in the socio-cultural and political conditions which serve as a backdrop for appropriations of Baudelaire’s texts in genres including black metal and experimental pop. She is currently in the process of preparing a monograph which looks at song settings and appropriations of Baudelaire’s poetry in modern pop, rock and rap music.",
      "Caroline is also pursuing new avenues in her research, looking at social and professional networks in nineteenth-century Paris. Her future research outputs seek to build on her expertise in digital humanities and apply techniques drawn from fields including the social sciences and statistics to the study of literature and culture. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, forthcoming projects involve using social network analysis  (SNA) techniques to tease out alternative historical narratives and re-evaluate sites of artistic cross-pollination in late nineteenth-century France.",
      "Within the context of her research, Caroline is particularly committed to public engagement, exploring new ways of using technology, in particular mixed reality tools, to communicate scholarship to a wider audience."

His monograph on the European Court of Justice, now in its second edition, has been described as ‘an excellent book…useful, well-conceived and thoroughly well-executed…’",
      "His recent work has examined the response of the Member States to decisions of the European Court of Justice perceived as ‘activist’; the changing style of scholarship on European Union law; the approach of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords to European Union law; the process which led to the Treaty of Lisbon and the various crises by which that process was punctuated; the events surrounding the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by Ireland; the principle of effective judicial protection in European Union law; the effect of the Treaty of Lisbon on the European Court of Justice; judicial dialogue in the European Union; and the role academics might play in responding to the case law of the European Court of Justice."

      "My research is about literature and mobility, that is, how the movement of people, books and ideas affects how people read and write. I study how early modern writers in England and Scotland draw on literary and linguistic resources associated with France, with a particular interest in how sociocultural factors affect writing and reading practices. My work is conscious of ‘English literature’ as a powerful category that shapes my research but does not reflect the historical diversity of multilingual literary practices in places where English is used.",

It uses a wider range of manuscript and print sources than the traditional focus on ‘French influence on English literature’ has usually invited, with case studies on poets writing in French to James, Esther Inglis, and William Drummond among others. I also have wider interests in the impact of Huguenot culture in Britain, and foreign-language publication in anglophone territories.",
      "My research is increasingly informed by the analytical framework that critical and ethnographic sociolinguistic research offers for investigating complex and diverse writing and reading practices across time. I wrote a preliminary description of this style of ‘historical ethnographic’ research in the introduction to a volume called Multilingual Texts and Practices in Early Modern Europe (Routledge, 2023) that I co-edited with Sheldon Brammall. This grew out of an international symposium in 2019 on ‘Multilingual Practices in Early Modern Literary Culture’, which was funded by the AHRC Open World Project MEITS. This project developed in turn from the Early Modern Boundaries network (2015-17) that I set up using a British Academy Rising Star Engagement Award.",
      "These theoretical and methodological questions arose from my detailed empirical work on the reception history of James VI and I’s favourite poet, Guillaume de Saluste Du Bartas (1544-90). My doctoral thesis and numerous shorter pieces supplied case studies that support the argument made in Du Bartas’ Legacy in England and Scotland (Oxford, 2019) that Du Bartas’ extraordinary renown led his works to provide a vital model for popular religious and epic verse to which Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, Anne Bradstreet, John Milton, Lucy Hutchinson and many other sixteenth- and seventeenth-century poets writing in English responded. A highlight of my archival research for this project was re-discovering 800 verses from Du Bartas’ late poetry.",

      "One strand of my research revolves around the translation into Italian of Italian-Canadian works, especially women’s works, with a specific focus on issues such as queerness and self-translation. On the subject I published the book Italian-Canadian Narratives of Return: Analysing Cultural Translation in Diasporic Writing (Palgrave 2019). Another strand of my research concerns the role of translation in Italian queer feminist activism. I am mainly interested in exploring the concepts of performativity and affect in relation to how translations are performed and received within these scenarios. On the topic I have published a few articles and chapters and I am currently co-editing with Jonathan Evans and Ting Guo a special issue of TIS (Translation and Interpreting Studies) on Translation and LGBT/Queer activism. In 2020 I also completed, with co-translator Elena Basile, the translation into English of the book by Italian scholar Lorenzo Bernini Queer Theories. An Introduction (Routledge 2020)."

      "Simon’s PhD research is on methods to estimate and evaluate components of variability from pre-existing datasets containing repeated biomarker measurements taken on subjects over time, such as in clinical trial and routine data sources. Unlike when conducting prospective longitudinal Biological Variability Studies (BVS), pre-existing datasets rarely contain the necessary data required for methods commonly used in longitudinal BVS. Methods that address the limitations of using pre-existing datasets have important implications to investigating how components of variability can be estimated and evaluated retrospectively."

      "My research reflects an interdisciplinary attention to the role of music and visual culture within the intellectual history of early modern England, particularly music's intersection with natural philosophy, the passions, and concepts of sense perception. Recent publications focus on English song, visual and material culture, and the idea of historical experience, revising of the way vernacular recreational music is perceived and taught.",
      "'Musical-Visual Culture in Early Modern England' marks the first dedicated study of depictions of music making in late-Elizabethan, early-Stuart England. It will not only deepen our understanding of early modern emotion but revise narratives about the role of aesthetic experience in seventeenth century intellectual history. For historiographical reasons, art historians and musicologists have yet to analyse together the large body of song and visual culture that explores shared metaphysical topoi, including sensing, dreaming, and love. Focusing on song and musical imagery, my project contributes to our understanding of how visual and auditory sensing built interiority in the home and the self."

      "Koen does interdisciplinary research on relationships between citizens and government. He has created an international profile as a leading scholar in four interrelated areas: public encounters, social innovation, action research, and interpretive policy analysis.",
      "Koen has rekindled research interest in public encounters: the relational dynamics ‘in-between’ and around citizens and public professionals. He has studied communicative practices and relational patterns in the context of community participation, collaborative governance, community organising and tax administration. In a range of publications, he reveals what happens when citizens and public professionals meet and what this means for democracy and social justice. He has developed an original theory of communicative capacity that explains how they communicate, why this is so difficult, and what could lead to more productive conversations. His 2013 article on public encounters has become a key reference point in the field.",
      "Koen explores how to sustain social innovation in local governance. He conducts action research with social innovators and local governance stakeholders to support transformative change in system dynamics. His work has addressed relational dynamics of resistance and change, experiential learning, intermediaries and social innovation ecosystems. Over the next years, he will be involved in grant-funded projects in Birmingham and the Netherlands that examine how social prescribing can reduce place-based health inequalities and advance a social model of wellbeing. Together with teams of academics and practitioners, he will co-produce community-driven practices of collaborating, joint learning and advancing systems change.",
      "Koen has taken a leading role in developing action research in policy analysis and beyond. He has developed a relational approach to co-producing learning and change in urban governance and, with Julia Wittmayer, a critical-relational approach to advancing sustainability transitions. Together, they have organised a series of conference panels and grown a network of action researchers in the field of policy analysis, culminating in a co-authored article, two special issues and an edited volume. Koen has also curated a themed issue for the Action Research Journal, where he is Associate Editor, on the dark side of action research. He is currently collaborating with Davydd Greenwood and Johan Ravn on ‘Call to Action Research: Confronting Political-Economic Inequality, Societal Instability, and Environmental Collapse’ (Edward Elgar).",
      "Koen’s research is at the forefront of the field of interpretive policy analysis. He has improved conceptual understanding of policy as practice and, with Nick Turnbull, relational thinking in public administration and policy analysis. He has co-organised two sections at the ECPR General Conference and co-edited a special issue that have reinvigorated the approach of deliberative policy analysis. With Hendrik Wagenaar, he has published an article about learning and teaching qualitative research and is currently writing ‘Doing Interpretive Research: Experience, Learning and Teaching’ (Oxford University Press)."

      "My research focuses on how law, regulation, and governance shape economies, societies, and subjectivities, especially in terms of gender and sexuality.",
      "In 2009 I published a book exploring the impact of the World Bank’s development lending on gender and sexuality, with case studies of Ecuador and Argentina. Rather than exploring areas of lending that were already marked as being about sex, such as HIV/AIDS or reproductive health, I analysed lending that seemed to be about other things, such as export promotion in floriculture, or institutional strengthening in the aftermath of economic crisis. The book showed how multi-lateral development institutions like the Bank played a key role in shaping gender and sexuality in the Global South. It called for much greater debate about this on the part of academics and development practitioners. As a result of this work, I was invited by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development to write a report on care debates in the UN, which looked at sexuality and disability. In 2014, in the aftermath of World Bank President Jim Yong Kim’s critique of Uganda for passing anti-gay legislation, I was invited to the Bank to give a presentation on sexuality and development. My research has also been used by Sexuality Policy Watch, a global sexual rights organisation, and by the gender team in the Bretton Woods Project, an organisation that monitors the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.",
      "Another strand of my research considers the gendered political economy of gambling regulation. Critical political economists have long used gambling to think through capitalism, but they tend to do so via analogies with casinos. I am interested in other, differently gendered, more vernacular gambling forms. I am especially interested in bingo, a lottery-style game popular in many parts of the world about which there is almost no academic research, and certainly not in law. Bingo has a very different demographic to casinos, being especially popular with older, working class women, and, in North America and Australia, with Indigenous peoples. In addition, bingo is intriguing because it is associated with mutual aid and charitable fundraising as much as, if not more than, commercial gambling in many places. I wanted to know what impact that mix had on regulatory priorities in different places, and what that in turn could teach us about the political economy of gambling regulation. After some pilot projects in England and Canada, in 2013 I was awarded a large ESRC grant to research the comparative regulation of bingo. The research team have generated a number of academic and non-academic outputs, including a public debate about bingo regulation in the UK, and major policy report exploring Brazil, the UK, the EU, and Canada (The Bingo Project). I have also submitted evidence from the research to the Department for Culture, Media, and Sport, as part of their policy work on responsible gambling and online gambling. My academic monograph on what bingo can teach us about regulating capitalism won the 2020 Hart-SLSA book prize and the 2020 International Political Economy book prize of the British International Studies Association. I am currently writing a piece on the moral economy of gambling in the pandemic context, and the role of sumptuary law in affordability checks.",
      "My current research is on the increasing role played by law within debates about gender, sexuality, and development. For example, I have analysed what early debates about gender and development said about law, in an effort to re-write our histories of law and development. Working with academics in Ecuador, I have explored the role of criminal law within Ecuadorian attempts to combat domestic violence. I am current exploring the role of gender and law in the World Bank's work to combat non-communicable diseases, including as related to alcohol."

Her commitment to social transformation is animated in her scholarship and practice of critical pedagogy and participatory research with historically marginalised communities. She seeks to contribute to epistemic justice in higher education and society. Her work is influenced by the Black-Archipelago, anticolonial tradition and the writings of Frantz Fanon, Sylvia Wynter, Aimé Césaire, Édouard Glissant and Paulo Freire."

      "My first book, Imprisonment in Early Modern England: Politics and Debt in a Carceral Society, 1550-1700, will offer new insight into both the nature of early modern society and the origins of modern carceral practices. It reveals that from the mid-sixteenth century, England was an increasingly carceral society; the threat of imprisonment for debt loomed over social relations defined by personal credit as economic change led to rising social instability and civil litigation. Anxiety over financial ruin, public shame and loss of liberty became the stuff of everyday life. Exploring the significance of this phenomenon, I will uncover the prison’s internal social structures, its place within wider society and its role in political conflict.",
      "In addition, this book will provide a much-needed early modern perspective to histories of imprisonment. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century developments solidified a new logic of imprisonment as a vital tool of social order, much of which persisted even as prisons were reformed into the principal mode of criminal punishment. Thus, I reveal how straining credit networks, swelling inmate populations and political upheaval reshaped early modern prisons and their social worlds, and the resonances this had within and beyond the prison walls. I am also developing new research into the proliferation and adaptation of debt imprisonment throughout England’s Atlantic colonies.",
      "My next project, ‘Paying for the State: Fees and Authority in Early Modern England and Wales’, uncovers the significance of fees to state formation and everyday experiences of authority. It will explore the implications of widespread payment of fees to officeholders for our understandings of state finance and formation, as well as how men and women across the social spectrum explicitly described encounters with the early modern state in the years leading up to English Revolution. By asking how people engaged with, thought about and sometimes pushed back against the tendrils of the decentralised state, I will test the extent, limits and ambiguities of personal participation and negotiation with institutional authority. As with my work on prisoners, I will explore how conceptions of political authority, exposed in everyday interactions with the state, intersected with political debates about rights, authority and governance that dominated seventeenth-century England."

This work, entailing interviews with solicitors, mediators and grandparents themselves, seeks to identify obstacles that are being experienced by grandparents in this context, and to consider how the support being offered to them may be optimised. See what she has written about this project here.",
      "Charlotte also jointly established the Family Law Reform Now network, bringing together academics, practitioners and policymakers to pinpoint, and ultimately address, key areas of family law reform. As part of this work, an edited collection was published in 2024 with Hart.",
      "She has previously conducted research, funded through the Socio-legal Studies Association’s Research Grant scheme, comparing the legal approach to financial remedies against the financial practices of modern day couples ‘on the ground’. Further, she has written on shared parental leave and, for her doctoral thesis, she explored how civil partnerships might help to challenge social and legal constructions about the gendered nature of roles in relationships. More specifically, she looked at how legal professionals negotiated gender in their interactions with their lesbian and gay clients in the context of financial remedies on relationship breakdown, and whether they were still attempting to apply traditional norms of masculinity and femininity (i.e., breadwinning versus homemaking)."

      "Lucía’s research lines are inspired by the ever-changing puzzle pieces that make up the global landscape of abortion, social movements, human rights, and the law. She generates new knowledge by exploring tensions between (legal) principles, values, norms, and international human rights standards, and by applying empirical-legal methods to understand the impact of laws on people’s trajectories to care, including in settings like Kenya, Uruguay, and Poland. Her most recent research projects included an analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on abortion in Africa, an evaluation of 10 years of implementation of the Uruguayan abortion law and an exploration of abortion activism in Africa. Lucía’s research agenda is built on partnerships with key stakeholders from the policy-making arena, social movements (various grassroots organizations), and international bodies (i.e. WHO).",
      "Her current British Academy project aims to uncover the entangled relationships between SMA and abortion law and regulation and, by so doing, to set the agenda for legal scholarship’s engagement with SMA. Applying a socio-legal approach that mixes qualitative and doctrinal legal analysis, Lucía will explore how abortion law and regulation impact SMA practices; how SMA practices affect abortion law and regulation; how SMA practices have impacted international human rights law and global health governance. This project builds on existing feminist work that challenges medico-legal models to suggest a new understanding of abortion care that confounds the paradigms on which existing legal frameworks are built."

      "The main focus of my research is the artistic and visual culture of domesticity in France 1880-1940 as framed by questions deriving from feminist methodologies. On the one hand my research lies in painterly, avant-garde, domesticities and, on the other, in mass-consumed, mediated domesticities.",
      "My monograph, Edouard Vuillard, the Nabis, and the Politics of Domesticity was published January 2025 by Bloomsbury Academic/Bloomsbury Visual Arts in the Material Culture of Art and Design series. It is the first book-length feminist engagement with Vuillard and Intimisme.",
      "I was guest curator to the international loan exhibition ‘Maman: Vuillard and Madame Vuillard’ at the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, October 2018 to January 2019. With Mathias Chivot of the Archives Vuillard, Paris, I was co-author of the exhibition’s fully-illustrated catalogue, Maman: Vuillard and Madame Vuillard, published 2018 by Paul Holberton Publishing.",
      "I also research mass media publications associated with the hugely popular interwar Salon des Arts Ménagers (1923-1983), including the journal L'Art Ménager and the annual exhibition poster. My article ‘Housewife Writ Large: Marie mécanique, Paulette Bernège and New Feminist Domesticity in Interwar France’ that critically analyses the representation of housewife-automata in SAM publicity materials was published May 2017 in the Oxford Art Journal.",
      "I am in the process of building a research project on the theme of ‘Nabi Politics: Art at the Vanguard of Debate after 1888’. This project will investigate the political and social attitudes of the influential Nabi artists, who rose to artistic prominence in Paris at the end of the nineteenth century. By studying their work, objectives and affiliations in unprecedented detail, the project will develop an innovative critical perspective that casts much-needed new light on the Nabis' approach to art and design, promotes public engagement with their work and offers fresh insights into the turbulent relationship between culture and politics in 1890s France; the decade of feminist congresses, labour agitation, anarchist bombings, presidential assassination and the Dreyfus Affair.",
      "I have been researcher on three RCUK funded collaborative research projects: as co-investigator to AHRC Suburban Birmingham: Spaces and Places, 1880-1960 (University of Birmingham, Birmingham Museums Trust, Library of Birmingham, 2009-2012) and as postdoctoral research fellow at AHRC Centre for the Study of the Domestic Interior (Royal College of Art, Victoria & Albert Museum, Royal Holloway, University of London, 2001-2003). I was Principal Investigator and lead supervisor to the successfully completed AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award ‘Displaying Childhood Spaces’."

A central concern within my research has been the relationship between Sharia and ethics, in theory, in practice, and in relation to applied issues. My work on applied ethical thinking has included considering issues around free speech, artificial intelligence, and human plurality. My research maintains a particular focus on Modern Twelver Shī ͑ī legal theory and its value as a discourse for exploring such questions, and I continue to benefit from collaborations with scholars that centre different methods (e.g. Anthropologists), and those who work out of different religious and philosophical traditions (both Muslim and non-Muslim).",

      "I am currently developing my PhD thesis, ‘Mentoring Relationships in the Lives and Literature of Eighteenth-Century Prose Writers’, for publication as a monograph, Mentoring the Mind. In it, I argue that the concept of ‘mentorship’, which was first developed in the eighteenth century, is founded on voluntary, reciprocal engagement that nurtures mutual respect, esteem, and affection in a pedagogical context. Beyond mere knowledge transfer, I suggest, mentorship is critical for fostering personal and social development, emotional growth, and mutual enrichment. The first chapter of my thesis is published as an article, ‘The Eighteenth-Century Mentor Book’, in the Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies: <https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-0208.12937>.",
      "My research makes use of psychoanalytical and psychotherapeutic frameworks in its approach to literature. I am always interested in new developments within these traditions, and to this end, I also reviewed Allan V. Horwitz’s Personality Disorders: A Short History of Narcissistic, Borderline, Antisocial, and Other Types for The British Society for Literature and Science."

      "My research focuses on agency and digital media, with a particular interest in how agency can be supported or constrained by the affordances of software, hardware, circumstances of production, and cultural contexts.",
      "My work is informed by game studies, media studies, philosophy, cultural studies, and visual culture. I completed my PhD, jointly funded by the AHRC, the National Productivity Investment Fund, and The University and Nottingham, in 2021. My book Videogames and Agency (Routledge 2023), offers a new conceptual framework that helps us understand how freedom to act is discussed by game developers, and how that in turn reflects in their design principles. By doing so the book presents a unique approach to studying agency that combines game design, game studies, and game developer discourse. Besides this, I also published on designing for playfulness, narrativity in videogames, and cosy games. I am currently interested in the connection between the recent (re)emergence of cosy media aesthetics and neoliberalism."

      "Dr Susanne Börner is Assistant Professor in Human Geography at the University of Birmingham. Her research focuses on youth everyday agency, emotions and urban well-being in the context of interconnected urban crises. She also researches on the interconnections of climate change and mental health as well as decolonial perspectives on human-nature relations, individual and planetary healing and ancestral wisdom. Susanne is particularly interested in the experiences of those growing up and living ‘at the margins’, such as children and young people as well as multi-generational contexts of knowledge generation. Susanne has a particular interest in participatory knowledge co-production. Her Marie Curie Global Fellowship (2019-2023) explored how young people in Brazil can live better with and develop long-term (emotional) resilience in contexts of resource scarcity and disaster risk. As theme lead for the research theme “ Sustainable, Liveable and Resilient Cities” at the Centre for Urban Wellbeing she also aims to generate pathways for integrating youth knowledge into public policies for a healthy urban development. Here, she aims to learn from community-based knowledges, lived experiences, knowings, beings, and everyday practices to generate positive change.",
      "Susanne is founder of White Owl Shamanism Shamanic Healing and Counselling in Birmingham. She is also a member of the Code Red Alliance, conference officer for the RGS-IBG research group Geographies of Childhood, Youth and Families (GCYFRG) and an ordinary member of the RGS-IBG Participatory Geographies Research Group."

      "My research focuses on exploring specific medical discourses and practices, such as anatomical dissection, in order to analyse contemporary performance practice. My work has examined constructions of power and knowledge, ethics, visuality, spectatorship and theatricality in the work of ORLAN, Martin O'Brien and the Bodyworlds Exhibition, for instance, and has been published in a number of journals and edited collections, including Performance Research and Contemporary Theatre Review. My monograph, Performing Specimens: Biomedical Display in Contemporary Peformance was published by Bloomsbury Methuen in 2021. I have also published two co-edited books: Performance and the Medical Body (2016) and The Routledge Companion to Performance and Medicine (2024), both with Dr Alex Mermikides.",
      "Recently, I have written chapters on surrogacy and issues of female reproroductive labour on the contemporary stage. I am currently developing work on performance and the NHS, with my collaborator, Alex Mermikides, and have plans to publish another monograph on theatre and biopolitics."

      "She is co-author of (OUP, 2nd ed., 2008). Her other research interests include public law, EU law and comparative law. In constitutional law, she has always had an interest in mapping and understanding the dynamics that prompt constitutional change in different types of constitutional orders. More recently, she has researched the attempts to use mediation to resolve disputes in administrative law. At present, she is devising a comparative research project on the framework for control of discretionary powers, an area of administrative law which is particularly topical in the UK and which would benefit from more comparative law research.",
      "Sophie Boyron is co-author of Principles of French Law  (OUP, 2nd ed., 2008) and author of The Constitution of France: A contextual analysis (Hart Publishing, 2013). Her other research interests include public law, EU law and comparative law. In constitutional law, she has always had an interest in mapping and understanding the dynamics that prompt constitutional change in different types of constitutional orders. In administrative law, she has researched the attempts to use mediation to resolve disputes in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. To this effect, she has just spent two months with the Tribunal administratif of Grenoble (France) to observe, record and assess its court-based mediation pilot and to study the introduction of a reform - enacted on 18 November 2016 – that creates a legislative framework for optional mediation in all French administrative courts. Finally, as a comparative lawyer, she has had to wrestle repeatedly with questions of translation. Realising that legal translation remains underexplored, particularly from a socio-legal perspective, she is committed to exploring the intersection of law and translation from an inter-disciplinary perspective so as to help shape a socio-legal agenda in this area. To do so, she has co-organised an IAS workshop entitled ‘Translating legal cultures: issues of legal translation in a globalised world’ in September 2016 and is co-organising an SLSA funded seminar entitled ‘Law, translation and migration: an enlightening relationship’ in September 2017."

      "My research focuses on early modern poetry, and particularly its relationship to classical and European contexts. So far, I have undertaken two major lines of research, both centred upon the early modern reception of Virgil.",
      "The first resulted in my monograph, The English Aeneid: Translations of Virgil, 1555-1646 (EUP), as well as an on-going series of articles. In this line of research, I have concentrated on a run of thirteen translations of at least a full book of the Aeneid that appeared from the accession of Elizabeth until the Civil Wars. This remarkable series of translations constituted a sustained dialogue about the poem that extends across the entire century. Since the monograph appeared in 2015, I have continued to research early modern translation, recently working on translation theory, an edition of an unprinted manuscript translation from the Civil Wars, as well as chapters on Gavin Douglas and John Dryden.",
      "The second line of research has been the basis of my Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship over the past three years, ‘The Appendix Vergiliana and the Renaissance Art of Discernment’. In this project, I am looking at poems that were attributed to Virgil during the Renaissance, but which we today no longer consider authentic. Early modern canons of classical authors sometimes differ remarkably from our contemporary ones, and Virgil is a case in point. The Appendix Vergiliana is a large collection of poems that were attributed to Virgil from antiquity through the early modern period. The collection includes an epyllion about a gnat’s journey to the underworld, a metamorphosis narrative about the Megarian princess Scylla, and a collection of shorter pieces (epigrams, curses, autobiographical poems, erotic verse). Modern studies of Virgil tend to ignore these works because we no longer consider them authentic, but to a Renaissance reader they represented a significant portion of Virgil’s early output. My project is to write this other Virgil back into our understanding of Renaissance poetry, and to explore the steps by which the modern Virgilian canon was formed. The poets and scholars I am studying range from Angelo Poliziano and Pietro Bembo to Edmund Spenser and John Milton. I am especially concerned with how the Appendix can reshape our understanding of literary careers and personal literary styles in the early modern period. The research will produce a second monograph in the upcoming years."

      "To investigate this process, I utilise a suite of particle counting instruments, including the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), particle size magnifier (PSM), and the neutral cluster and air ion spectrometer (NAIS). As well as this, I utilise state of the art on-line chemical ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry to investigate oxidation chemistry and cluster formation in the atmosphere. These instruments are deployed on field campaigns in the urban environment (Barcelona, Beijing) and the remote polar (Antarctica)."

      "My current research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms of the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT); a telomere maintenance mechanism which supports the proliferation of 10-15% of all cancers, including high-grade glioma. There are currently no useful treatments for these ALT-reliant tumours, which represents a clear unmet need in healthcare. I am particularly interested in a process called break-induced telomere synthesis (BITS), which mediates telomere elongation in ALT-reliant cells whereby DNA breaks arising from collapsed replication forks within telomeric arrays are clustered together to facilitate recombination-mediated repair.",
      "My research seeks to address several key questions: How is BITS co-ordinated with other DNA repair mechanisms in the cell? How is telomere clustering carried out? How does replication fork collapse and DNA repair at telomeres in ALT-reliant cells impact telomere sequence? Answering these key questions will uncover the molecular mechanisms of ALT and has the potential to identify therapeutic targets and biomarkers for the treatment and diagnosis of ALT-reliant cancers."

      "My research primarily addresses the social and cultural histories of Nazi Germany, with a particular focus on the period of the Second World War and its aftermaths. My first book, German Catholicism at War, 1939-1945, analyses how a significant section of the Third Reich’s population understood and responded to the conflict, including both the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazi regime, and the devastation increasingly wrought upon German society itself. Focusing on the Rhineland and Westphalia as a case study, I combine an exploration of the Catholic Episcopate and clergy’s theological understandings of the war with a social and cultural history of religious belief, practice and mentality on the ground. Using a host of previously unused sources gathered in a range of church, state and private archives, my book makes a new contribution to our understandings of German society’s moral economy during the Second World War, and highlights how the politics of Catholic belief and community helped maintain the resilience of the Reich’s home front until 1945. The doctorate from which this book developed won the runner-up award for the Wiener Library’s Fraenkel Prize in 2014.",
      "My new research project flows from the above, and concerns German society’s responses to bereavement during the Second World War and its aftermaths. It addresses the histories of grief and mourning in German (and Austrian) society during the Second World War itself and how they evolved afterwards, into the late 1950s, in order to pursue this question in all three of the Third Reich’s successor states. By exploring personal diaries and letters alongside artistic representations of wartime loss, the design of public spaces, war memorials and acts of commemoration, the project analyses how Nazi Germany and its successor states attempted to cope with the challenge of mass bereavement, and to address the sentiments of their populations. This project aims to go beyond top-down understandings of grief and memory as fashioned into ‘useable pasts’ by individual political regimes and seeks to uncover the wider social and cultural frameworks which shaped private and familial repertoires of mourning during the 1940s and 50s."

The monograph will focus on the lives of female singers who performed and constructed their careers mainly in gatherings held by the upper echelons of the social elite in the satellite courts of Rome. In this study I will focus on the different roles these women played in elite society, the types of relationships they developed with elite men and women, and their active participation in the political happenings of the courts."

      "My research sits at the intersection of Translation Studies, Early Modern Studies, Comparative Literature, and German Studies. My work has dealt largely with transnational cultural history in the period 1500-1800. I have examined in particular the role of women in European intellectual life, challenging some of the old assumptions about women as marginalised and insignificant and contributing to cross-discipline debates about gender as a category of analysis.",
      "I have worked extensively on the history of women translators. My postdoctoral project, funded by the Leverhulme Trust and AHRC, examined the voluminous but neglected translations of Germany’s first prominent woman of letters, Luise Gottsched (1713-1762). My monograph Luise Gottsched the Translator (2012) showed how translation was at the heart of Gottsched’s œuvre and part of an ambitious and progressive programme which had a profound impact on German culture of the Enlightenment. More recently, I have been developing my work on the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Between 2017 and 2019, I spent extended periods of time at the Herzog August Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel working on early modern translation as a Senior Research Fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. The resulting monograph, Women and Early Modern Cultures of Translation: Beyond the Female Tradition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2022), brings a European perspective to a field dominated by Anglocentric scholarship, and in doing so argues for a reassessment of the significance of gender in translation history. I have contributed articles on gender and translation to major reference works including the Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies (3rd edition, 2019).",
      "I also have a long-standing interest in Anglo-German cultural relations, dating back to my MA and PhD days. My PhD project explored the links between women's writing in Germany and Britain in the late eighteenth century by means of a detailed case study and was published as Benedike Naubert (1756-1819) and her Relations to English Culture (2005). I am currently co-editor of ANGERMION: Yearbook for Anglo-German Literary Criticism, Intellectual History and Cultural Transfers / Jahrbuch für britisch-deutsche Kulturbeziehungen (De Gruyter)",

I have written and co-authored work in topics including the relationship between intentions and motor representations in action production, the ascription of intentions in social cognition, and the role of sense of commitment in social media interactions. In aesthetics, I work mainly on issues concerning design. I have written about the aesthetic appreciation of perfumes, and I have defended the idea that some perfumes are works of art."

Bryson (BA (Hons) TCD, PhD Leic., FAcSS, FRGS, FHEA, FeRSA) has held research and teaching posts at the Universities of St Andrews, Cambridge, Wales and most recently at the University of Birmingham where he is Professor of Enterprise and Economic Geography. He was Director of the Service and Enterprise Research Unit (SERU) and founder of City-REDI.",
      "An economic geographer whose research focusses on understanding people and organisations in place and space and the ways in which place-based adaptation occurs including understanding barriers and enablers to adaptation. He has made significant contributions to understanding and explaining the complex ways in which production is organized through space and in place and via a variety of forms of enterprise.",
      "Much of his research has focussed on developing an integrated approach to understanding city-regions. This includes research on property development and investment, financialization, infrastructure, knowledge-intensive services, manufacturing adaptation and innovation, alternative forms of innovation including end-user innovation, urban sustainability and resilience, air quality and environmental pollution, productivity, internationalisation, service offshoring and manufacturing reshoring, and innovation systems. One of his cross-cutting research interests including understanding rapid adaptation during times of disruptive and radical change. This includes citizen-led end-user innovation and the development of alternative solutions in response to private and public sector failure. This includes research on responsible citizenship and the role that responsible citizens can play in overcoming local infrastructure failure. It also includes a focus on resilience and the management of resilience."

      "I was the first in my family to pursue higher education. I attended a local comprehensive school and a sixth-form college in the small Black Country town of Stourbridge before enrolling at the University of Birmingham as an undergraduate student in English Literature in 2005. After a lengthy hiatus from learning (and numerous different jobs in both private industry and the public sector) I made the step to go back into academia, with Birmingham as my instant choice. My AHRC-funded doctoral research (2012-16) produced the first full-length investigation into the sixteenth-century dream vision; a genre has always fascinated me, but which was believed to have died out with the medieval era. My research shows that this is a mode of expression which thrived well into the seventeenth century through the works of authors both prolific and, in many cases, marginalised or unknown. My aim in this thesis was to challenge prevailing theories about the dream-vision’s intellectual, aesthetic, and socio-political power, while also bringing to light poets who have been previously miscategorised or ignored.",
      "Several projects spiralled out of this work, and I have had articles published in Modern Philology, Comparative Drama and The Journal of Early Modern Studies, spanning an array of topics, from the adaptation of Chaucer and Spenser in early modern plays and poems, to presentations of early modern tavern culture and Mary Queen of Scots in the works of the Staffordshire servant-poet Richard Robinson.",
      "Lately, my focus has turned to the role of sleep, dreaming, and domestic space in the works of early modern women, blending my interests in material culture, Renaissance horticulture, literary invention, and the gendered imagination. These ideas provide the foundation for my upcoming monograph on early modern women’s dream-vision poetry (circa 1586-1700) by authors from across the British Isles."

I believe that robust research on the role of religion in society can inform public policy and perceptions. To this end, I have devoted a significant part of my PhD study to studying the everyday, inter-community interactions between London residents originating from different cultural and religious backgrounds.",

This project will address a significant gap in the current sociology of science and religion by investigating how the relationship between Islam and science is understood and discussed by those involved in the transmission of Islamic knowledge and the establishment of Islamic authority in Britain. The project will be informed by my continuing interest in documenting unheard views, breaking down stereotypes fed by misinformation and studying lived realities for religious individuals in liberal societies."

We know that the books accessed by children can work to challenge or enforce stereotypes, and the messages conveyed in illustrations can impact how children feel about themselves and others. Children’s ideas and opinions are shaped by exposure to visual stimuli and early learning experiences, meaning that the power of children’s literature in promoting inclusion and equity in the next generation is of paramount importance.",

      "Recently I have worked mainly on issues involving phenomenal concepts: i.e. concepts that conscious subjects are said to have of what it is like for them to undergo experiences. Advocates of what has become known as the ‘phenomenal concepts strategy’ in the debate over the metaphysics of consciousness maintain that these concepts enjoy peculiarly direct semantics, and they invoke this feature in an attempt to defuse influential anti-physicalist arguments. In ‘Do Phenomenal Conceps Misrepresent?’ (abstract) - forthcoming in Philosophical Psychology, I defend this approach against a recent attack by James Tartaglia, and in the near future I hope to extend my defence so as to address other philosophers who attack the phenomenal concepts strategy in a manner similar to that of Tartaglia.",
      "In ‘Phenomenal Senses’ I complain that the theories advocated by orthodox advocates of the phenomenal concepts strategy are threatened by some of the same worries that face Millian accounts of singular reference, and I defend an alternative, neo-Fregean (and somewhat empiricist) account of phenomenal concepts which avoids these worries without surrendering dialectical ground to anti-physicalists. In ‘Frege and the Problem of Consciousness’ (forthcoming in Leach and Tartaglia (eds.) Consciousness and the Great Philosophers) I investigate what Frege himself might have thought about these issues.",
      "In ‘Phenomenal Justification and the Intuition of Distinctness’ I explore some of the epistemic ramifications of views like mine, and suggest that my proposal delivers a more satisfying explanation of why physicalism is hard to believe than does that of David Papineau (a prominent advocate of the orthodox conception of phenomenal concepts who explicitly addresses the question of why physicalism is hard to believe). In ‘Phenomenal Concepts and Language’, I explore the question whether phenomenal concepts are expressed by terms of ordinary languages, and defend a negative answer. A welcome consequence of this is that it provides advocates of the phenomenal concepts strategy with a novel response to recent attacks by Michael Tye and Derek Ball. In the near future I hope to explore ramifications of my views on the effability of phenomenal content for hoary old chestnuts such as Wittgenstein’s rule-following considerations and private language argument. (A short overview piece on the latter which I wrote a long time ago.)",
      "Another area of my work belongs to the intersection of philosophy of language, mind and epistemology. In ‘The Candour of Sense’ I defend the compatibility of semantic externalism with the neo-Fregean approach to singular reference. I argue that this requires us to overhaul the version of neo-Fregean externalism associated with John McDowell and Gareth Evans, but that the revisions I propose are independently defensible. ‘Weak Externalism’ and ‘Sufficient Absences: Constitution or Evidence?’ are older unpublished papers in which I explored other facets of the semantic externalism issue. For more older work in this area, see Publications below.",
      "A number of years ago I undertook to compare the holism about reasons which Jonathan Dancy defends in his work on moral particularism with other kinds of holism, such as those associated with confirmation and with meaning, and I drafted a paper defending a version of moral particularism which resembles Dancy’s in its epistemic aspects but not in its metaphysical ones. Since then I have been too busy with other projects to bring this paper to publishable form, but if anyone is interested, I’d be delighted to send you what I have, and to discuss."

      "Jorge’s group is interested in the cellular and molecular events that mediate the interactions between immune cells and stromal cells that results in lymphoid tissue formation during embryogenesis, and in adults during immune responses and inflammation. For example, the group has demonstrated the function of the Lymphotoxin beta receptor and NF-kB signalling in the maturation of stromal cells during lymph node development (Carragher et al. 2004 J Immunol173:2271-9, White et al. 2007 Blood 110:1950-9, Benezech et al. 2010 J Immunol 184:4521-30). By studying the fat pads that surround lymph nodes they have also shown that interactions between stromal cells from adipose tissues and immune cells leads to the reprogramming of the former to become lymph node stromal cells that have the capacity to support T cell survival ex vivo (Benezech et al. 2012 Immunity37:721-734).",
      "The recent work of the group has investigated the interactions between immune cells and adipocytes that result in the formation of a novel type of lymphoid tissue called Fat Associated Lymphoid Clusters (FALCs) located in the mesenteries, myocardium, and mediastinum. FALCs respond to inflammatory signals that result in an increase in the size and number of clusters (Benezech et al., 2015 Nat Immunol. 16:819-28). We have shown that innate and adaptive immune responses take place in FALCs.",
      "By dissecting the cellular processes in stromal and immune cells during lymphoid tissue formation we would like to understand how to either prevent the formation of ectopic lymphoid tissues during autoimmune diseases and to induce their development to support local immune responses against tumors. This knowledge will aid us in the fight against inflammation, uncontrolled immune responses and cancer."

      "My central research interest is society of medieval Iceland. Wider issues and aspects of this include approaches to narratives; saga literature, including Sagas of Icelanders and Sturlunga saga. My first book, Landscape, Tradition and Power in Medieval Iceland (Brill, 2020) considered these texts by examining two particular regions of Iceland against the backdrop of institutional and familial structures, and economic patterns. I am currently thinking very hard about the role of place-names in shaping and being shaped by medieval people's ideas about the past. This is informing articles I am writing about 'Celts' and slaves in early Iceland.",
      "I have been invited to contribute articles on the medieval Icelandic church to two books connected to the five-year research project on the major estate of Oddi in Iceland (Oddarannsóknin). One volume presents research for an international scholarly audience, the other (in Icelandic) presents its findings to the public.",
      "My next project is a book on the attitudes of people in Iceland towards slavery from the medieval to the modern period. Icelanders wrote extensively about their own origins and sometimes about slavery in other places. These texts provide a rich view of Icelanders' identities and self-perception.",
      "A long time ago I was a member of the AHRC-funded Viking Identities Network (2006-9) led by Prof. Judith Jesch (School of English, University of Nottingham) and have periodically worked on aspects of gender and the life course."

While much has been written on the policing of protest, comparatively little is known about what happens to those prosecuted in the courts. To remedy this, Steven is part of an interdisciplinary team examining the treatment of protestors in the courts. This has included the observation of a number of high profile trials, such as the trials of the Colston 4 and Stansted 15, as well as trials of Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain, Just Stop Oil, and Palestine Action activists."

The second, provisionally titled Raising Anita: Mothering, Other-Mothering, and Anti-fascism in Twentieth-Century Germany, Mexico, Brazil, and Beyond, focuses on Anita Prestes, child of Olga Benário Prestes (a militant Jewish, German, communist woman) and Luís Carlos Prestes (who would come to be leader of the Brazilian Communist Party). After a failed communist uprising in Brazil, Olga was deported to Germany, gave birth to Anita in a women’s prison, and, ultimately, was murdered in a Nazi extermination camp. Anita was raised by her grandmother and aunt, Leocádia and Lygia (respectively), who would carry her from country to country in exile. This book focuses on the networks they relied on and forged to raise Anita.",
      "I have also co-edited a volume titled Empty Spaces: Confronting Emptiness in National, Cultural, and Urban History, with Allegra Giovine and Jennifer Keating. This publication also led to a New Books Network interview. I am currently working on another edited volume titled Brazilian Regionalism in a Global Context with my co-editor Dr Glen Goodman of Arizona State University. I have published articles in Past & Present, Slavery & Abolition, and the Luso-Brazilian Review."

Her research investigates how the international and national legal systems can respond to women’s poverty, focusing on the potential of equality and anti-discrimination law. Her research has touched upon the right to education, sexual and reproductive health rights, rural inequality and the procedural aspects of international accountability mechanisms. Her future projects offer a comparative critique of how apex courts adjudicate whether the State is constitutionally permitted to limit women’s equality."

From 2025 to 2029 and with the SoundDecisions team, he will undertake archival, fieldwork, and quantiative research on the ways that farmer-musicians make everyday economic decisions and build trust through improvised music performance.",
      "Professor Cannon’s previous research has investigated the changing nature of traditional music practice in southern Vietnam. He has studied the genre đờn ca tài tử, a ‘music for diversion’ also called the ‘music of talented amateurs’. His 2022 monograph examines notions of creativity used by Vietnamese musicians to sustain interest in traditional music and to rejuvenate debates concerning the Vietnamese identity in an increasingly cosmopolitan and globalised Vietnam. Titled Seeding the Tradition: Musical Creativity in Southern Vietnam, he argues that southern Vietnamese musicians draw from long-standing theories of Daoist creation while adopting strategically from and also reacting to a western neo-liberal model of creativity focused on the individual genius. These musicians play with metaphors of growth, development, and ruin to maintain their tradition and keep it vibrant in the rapidly-shifting context of modern Vietnam."

      "I began my career as a historian of the nineteenth century U.S. South, examining the ways white and Black southerners engaged with the question of what a modern and imperial future of the region would look like through the imaginative spaces of World’s Fairs. Since the completion of the project in 2018, I have shifted my attention to national and global histories of technology and mobility within the field of U.S. foreign relations. Ultimately, my research explores the cultural dynamics of race and empire in the shaping of American modernity.",
      "Past Research: A Dream of the Future: Race, Empire and Modernity at the Atlanta and Nashville World’s Fairs (Oxford University Press, 2018).",
      "My first book considered the ways white and Black southerners promoted their region in an age of empire. In the late nineteenth century, southerners mobilized the Atlanta and Nashville world’s fairs to challenge popular images of the region as backward and agrarian. In doing so, they presented their own image of what a future and imperial South could be. Significantly, the Atlanta and Nashville fairs featured Black-run exhibits to which clerical and professional members of the local and national community rallied as a way to both challenge and accommodate Jim Crow. A chapter of the book was first published in the Journal of Southern History as “The South’s ‘New Negroes’ and African American Visions of Progress at the Atlanta and Nashville International Expositions, 1895-1897” (2014). The book received positive reviews in major journals, including the American Historical Review, Journal of Southern History, and the Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.",
      "In 2017, I published an article on convict labour in Louisiana following the Civil War in Louisiana History. “‘Less Than Mayhem’: Louisiana’s Convict Lease, 1865-1901” has been cited not only in the new histories of the carceral state but has informed work on the health of Louisiana’s contemporary prison population.",
      "Current Research: The World Awheel: Americans in the First Global Bicycle Age, 1885-1920 (Columbia University Press).",
      "My current research addresses contemporary needs for a fuller and wider understanding of the historical relationship between active mobility and the politics that shape our lives. Situating the first U.S. bicycle boom within a global framework, it reveals the ways in which inequalities rooted in empire were not separate from but mutually constitutive of American technology and culture.",
      "The World Awheel argues that the bicycle and its social and cultural worlds provide us with a grounded way to understand Americans’ experience and understanding of the world at the very moment the nation shifted from a continental settler empire to an overseas and imperial one. It highlights the ways that Americans understood themselves as in this world and the ways that the forces of empire both produced and influenced these outlooks at the exact juncture of the local, national, and global. With mass automobility only taking off after the First World War, the book asks how the bicycle—the most significant global technology of personal mobility during the key decades of the United States’ rise as an industrial and imperial power—influenced and shaped Americans’ experience and understanding of the world.",
      "I have published three articles related to the current book project that bridge my past and current research. “Cycling on the Color Line: Race, Technology, and Bicycle Mobilities in the Early Jim Crow South, 1887-1905” was published in Technology & Culture (2021). It argues that historians must look at technological solidification from the perspective of race to fully understand its social and cultural articulations. “Global Mass Culture, Mobile Subjectivities, and the Southern Landscape: The Bicycle in the New South, 1887-1920,” in the Journal of American Studies (2022) contends that the history of the bicycle in the New South can better reveal the ways the region was embedded in and not separated from the world at the end of the nineteenth century. A co-authored article in the Journal of Sport History follows the emergence and elaboration of cycling as a global sporting culture, casting light on how the sport was experienced across and between spaces that challenge notions of coherent “nationality and territoriality” in the crucial decade before the First World War.",
      "As an immensely popular technology, then and now, this project has afforded ample opportunities to engage with the public through newspaper articles, public talks, and events. I have published in The Washington Post’s “Made by History” series on the legacies of Jim Crow on mobility (2021); used an artefact from Birmingham’s Science and Technology Museum to write an accessible history of technological adaptation that highlights the city’s deep connection to the British Empire (2023); and mobilised an archive of unpublished photographs to explore Black mobility, childhood, and joy for Black Perspectives (2023). In 2024, I partnered with the BMT’s curator of science and technology on an AHRC impact fund to produce people-focussed histories of mobility that offers a roadmap for a sustainable future. The project resulted in a small exhibition accompanied by an accessible talk on the history of the bicycle in Birmingham. So far, over 50,000 visitors have viewed the exhibition. I have given public talks on the “Crises of Car Culture in 21st Century Birmingham,” and the history of Birmingham as a city of innovation."

      "My research looks at how language users understand idioms and other types of figurative phrase, such as conventional metaphors. My work has focused on the factors that influence processing and comprehension in native and non-native speakers, including aspects such as familiarity, transparency and context. I have also looked at cross-language effects in how idioms are recognised and understood in a series of studies on Chinese and Swedish learners of English. I am interested in extending this work to consider the effects of different cognitive variables such as working memory on how language users make sense of both known and unknown figurative phrases, as a way of better understanding the changes that might be seen in healthy aging and pathological conditions such as dementia or aphasia.",
      "I am also interested in formulaic language more generally, and have conducted several studies to explore the processing advantage for frequent phrases such as binomials (black and white, salt and pepper), where word order is highly conventionalised.",
      "My work uses experimental techniques such as eye-tracking, which is an invaluable tool in the study of reading comprehension. I also use other methodologies such as reaction times and offline techniques (ratings and speaker judgements) to build a detailed picture of how language users process language at the multiword level."

      "I work on a wide range of topics in medieval studies, from Old and early Middle English and Latin languages and literature to cross-period animal studies. My current research projects focus on predators in early medieval England and the Old English and Latin riddle traditions.",
      "My past research has analysed literary representations of material culture, constructed objects and textiles, as well as theoretical approaches to non-human animals and the natural world. My first book, Weaving Words and Binding Bodies: The Poetics of Human Experience in Old English Literature, explored the early medieval fascination with constructive processes and constrictive practices, emphasising the ways in which Old English texts depict everything from material objects and human/animal bodies to abstract concepts as shaped things.",
      "I am also the editor of The Riddle Ages: Early Medieval Riddles, Translations and Commentaries, whose aim is to provide open-access translations and commentaries of the Exeter Book and contemporary Latin riddles for an audience of students and interested members of the public. The website sponsors and I co-organise annual sessions on early medieval riddles with Jennifer Neville (RHUL) at the International Medieval Congress in Leeds.",

The book arises out of my AHRC-funded doctoral thesis, focusing on the 1670-71 theatrical season, and examining the cultural, political, and literary tensions that fuelled, and were reflected in, the season’s plays.",

      "Alongside articles on Restoration drama and satire, my published research has focused on archival research, exploring networks of manuscript transmission and the compilation of poetry miscellanies in the seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries. I have also written on the newly recovered manuscript of the academic drama Lingua (1607); I am preparing an edition of the play for publication by the Malone Society."

      "Heng Choon (Oliver) Chan, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor of Criminology at the University of Birmingham (previously affiliated with the Department of Social and Behavioural Sciences at City University of Hong Kong). He received his Ph.D. in Criminology from the University of South Florida, FL, USA, and was a recipient of the Outstanding Criminology Ambassador Award in 2012 and Distinguished Alumni Award in 2021. To date, Dr. Chan was presented with 9 awards to recognize his exemplary contributions to research and professional education; for instance, the Early Career Award (2014, Research Grant Council of the University Grants Committee, Hong Kong Government), The President’s Award (2017, Office of the President, CityU), CLASS New Researcher Award (2017, College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences [CLASS], CityU), Outstanding Supervisor Award (2018, the Provost Office, CityU), and CLASS Teaching Innovation Award – Team Award (2019, CLASS, CityU). When he was in the U.S., Dr. Chan interned and later employed by the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department’s Homicide Case Review Units as one of its first two Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Violent Criminals Apprehension Program (ViCAP) analysts.",
      "Dr. Chan’s research focuses on sexual homicide, sexual offending, stalking behaviour, psycho-criminology, and Asian criminology. He published widely on these topics, especially on sexual homicide. As of June 2023, Dr. Chan has published over 110 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters; and presented at numerous international, regional, and local academic conferences. He has since published 7 academic books, with 3 as the sole-authored monographs on sexual homicide and sexual offending (Wiley, 2023; Springer Nature, 2019; and Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), and another 4 as the lead co-editor of edited volumes on animal abuse and interpersonal violence (Wiley, 2023), the African mental health and criminal justice system (Palgrave Macmillan, 2021), the international perspective of stalking behaviour (Wiley, 2020), and the psycho-criminological perspective of Asian criminal justice (i.e., police, correctional, and legal psychology; Routledge, 2017).

      "David Chapman is Professor of Geotechnical and Underground Engineering. He is also the Technical Director for the National Buried Infrastructure Facility currently being developed at the University of Birmingham, which is part of the UK wide government funded project UKCRIC (UK Collaboratorium for Research in Infrastructure & Cities).",
      "His research interests lie in the area of underground construction (from pipelines to tunnels). He has published over 150 papers in both refereed journals and conferences. He has an international reputation in the area of trenchless pipeline installation and renewal, and has conducted research into tunnel construction in soft ground and how to better understand the performance of subsurface infrastructure using geophysical sensors.",
      "He has been involved with numerous grants from EPSRC and industry. In particular, he is currently co-investigator on the multi-disciplinary, multi-university EPSRC funded Assessing the Underworld project, and also co-investigator on the multi-disciplinary, multi-university EPSRC funded project Self Repairing Cities, as well as an investigator on an industry led project investigating Smart Leakage Detection of Pipes.",
      "He has been lecturing for 27 years in the area of soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering. He is also the co-author of a book ‘Introduction to Tunnel Construction’ (now in its second edition) aimed at MSc and MEng students or early career engineers.",

      "Mapping the Underworld and Assessing the Underworld",
      "The Mapping the Underworld (MTU) initiative was first initiated in 1996 when the term ‘Body Scanner in the Street’ was coined. This was followed with an EPSRC ideas factory in 2004 and the feasibility project started in 2005 investigating the abilities and limitations of a range of locating technologies to locate all buried utilities in all ground conditions, look at alternative technologies as well as investigate the mapping and data fusion of utility records. The feasibility study showed that a number of technologies have the potential to locate buried assets when used in combination and also combined with some information on the soil to optimise any survey strategies. This lead to the MTU Phase 2 Location project (2009-2012) with the focus of this project on the development of a multi-sensor device to locate all buried utilities in all ground conditions using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), low frequency electromagnetics, vibro-acoustics and leakage current fields.",
      "This led to a further project called Assessing the Underworld (2013-2018), where the objective has been not only to locate buried infrastructure, but also to assess its condition using geophysical methods. Due to the importance of the ground in supporting the surface infrastructure (e.g. roads) and the buried infrastructure (e.g. pipes), at Birmingham we have focused on assessing changes in the ground using geophysical methods.",
      "The MTU initiative is a 25 year vision with both condition assessment using a multi-sensor device and sustainable use of the underground infrastructure being addressed in the future.",
      "Smart Pipes (and other buried infrastructure monitoring)",
      "The interest in monitoring and mapping of underground infrastructure led to a number of projects investigating ways to make infrastructure ‘smarter’ using sensors, or at least to collect more data from buried infrastructure to allow better management. Such systems are called underground wireless sensor systems. One such sensor system for leak detection in pressurised water pipes developed at Birmingham is currently being taken forward as an industry led Innovate UK project.",

      "I am interested in breaking down boundaries – disciplinary, national, and historical. My expertise and experience are in Shakespeare and early modern literature more broadly, but I am as concerned with what is medieval or even modern about early modern literature, and how such boundaries come into existence. Most of my research so far has focused on how Shakespeare’s works can be read both in the context of their own time and the time that came before; how they prefigure ideas that came later; and even how the ideas being expressed by Shakespeare may not have had a means of theoretical expression in his own time.",
      "My first book, Shakespeare’s Ontology, which I am currently editing for publication, considers Shakespeare’s evident preoccupation with ‘being’ from the standpoint of philosophical ontology, questioning and clarifying how the plays and poems present existence. The aim is to reveal what ‘being’ involves that is different from, for instance, identity or subjectivity.",
      "The project I am currently working on, Shakespeare’s Untranslatability, continues this concern with philosophical ideas and boundary breaking from a more international perspective. My intent is to undo the separation between global Shakespeare and textual studies by using translations of Shakespeare as a way of reading Shakespeare. Specifically, I am undertaking a philosophical investigation of untranslatable elements in Japanese translations of Shakespeare to reveal the particularities and the limitations of the source text. Untranslatability invites a philosophical consideration of the source text, providing an opportunity to examine what makes the original language unique in ways that a monolingual native speaker might not realise. It also exposes Shakespeare’s supposed universality as a shibboleth by making visible the cultural norms inherent in his works."

      "John’s research interests centre on criminal law theory, and particularly the internal structuring of offences and defences within the general part, where he has published widely.",
      "Across a range of criminal law topics, John's research aims to bridge the divide between conceptual debate and doctrinal application; and to demonstrate how a greater theoretical understanding of the law can be translated into an effective counter to the global expansion of criminal proscriptions (ie, inappropriate or over-criminalisation). This includes work challenging whether certain wrongs are deserving of criminalisation (eg, his work on prior-fault; complicity; inchoate offences; etc), as well as defending minimum doctrinal requirements within the law from philosophical critique (eg, his work on the voluntary act requirement). John is regularly engaged in collaborative and interdisciplinary projects that allow him to gain different insights into a legal problem, as well as to produce more robust recommendations for legal reform.

      "My research focuses on systemic disparities in psychiatric care, particularly in the treatment of psychotic symptoms with religious versus spiritual themes. I aim to explore how biases, inadequate education on diverse religious practices, and policy frameworks contribute to these disparities. My work specifically examines the concept of malignant alienation, where service-users experience deterioration in care quality due to stigmatisation or misattribution of their symptoms, and its impact on treatment outcomes. I am currently looking to create a measure for malignant alienation due to a lack of scientific measures in research. Additionally, most research has focused on its links with suicide specifically. At the same time, nearly none have addressed recovery and treatment implications in care, nor do many focus on psychosis as a standalone mental illness. By addressing these issues, I seek to highlight systemic injustices in psychiatric care and advocate for holistic, culturally sensitive, and socially informed models of care. Through this work, I aim to drive meaningful policy change to promote equitable and compassionate mental health treatment."

      "Julian’s research focuses in two areas – developing critical understandings of the state (particularly how states materialize and exercise power, and the practices of state representation through geographies of diplomacy); and on critical governance approaches to natural resource management (particularly their complex associations with global change and social-ecological and socio-technical systems). He currently co-leads the Hidden Depths project funded by the Leverhulme Trust, examining the pressing issues of environmental change associated with mining sand from rivers in northern India and Bangladesh: sand mining is one of the most exploitative forms of resource management globally. Julian’s role in the project is to develop new approaches to understanding how and whether sand can be mined sustainably using innovative governance approaches. He also has ongoing ESRC funded impact related research examining sand extraction procedures and practices in Northern Ireland. As part of the EU funded PyroLife consortium, Julian has been working with colleagues in the Food and Agriculture Organization (Rome), European University (Cyprus) and Università degli Studi di Torino (Italy) to establish new ways to understand the governance and management of wildfires. Julian has written four monographs including The Modalities of European Union Governance (published with Oxford University Press), on the institutional pathways and spatial patterning of governance within the European Union, and The Spatialities of Europeanization (published with Routledge). He has 80 internationally peer reviewed publications, supported by funding from European Union, ESRC, European Science Foundation and NERC – DFID funded projects. His internationally leading research has led to appointments as specialist advisor to the UK House of Lords on governance of innovation in rural areas, and to the UK’s Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology on precision farming."

      "Barbara is a Research Fellow working in Dr Eva Frickel’s laboratory within the Institute of Microbiology and Infection (IMI), in the College of Life and Environmental Sciences. Barbara works on the cell intrinsic immune response to intracellular pathogens in human cells. She is particularly interested in the interferon gamma (IFNg)-driven control of Toxoplasma gondii at the parasite/cell interface, using high-content fluorescent microscopy to discover the mechanisms of infection control in different cell types.",
      "Barbara started her research career at the University of Liverpool where she gained a BSc in Medical Cell Biology and Biochemistry. She became interested in infectious disease research during work experience at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. This interest was pursued in Dr Iain Wilson’s laboratory at the National Institute for Medical Research, London where she obtained a PhD in the biophysical regulation of malarial parasite invasion into red blood cells.",
      "Her interest in malaria continued into a post-doctoral fellowship at St Mary’s Hospital Medical School, where she studied the pathogenesis of malaria with Professor Geoffrey Pasvol. Barbara’s research focused on the cytoadherence phenotypes in malarial parasites and their relationship to red blood cell invasion.  Barbara joined Dr Eva Frickel’s group at the National Institute for Medical Research in 2012 as a Senior Investigator Scientist and started research into cell-intrinsic immunity to Toxoplasma gondii, focusing on interferon gamma (IFNg)-driven host defence to the parasite. She continued investigating the IFNg- and ubiquitin-dependent restriction of Toxoplasma when the laboratory moved to the Francis Crick Institute in 2016. As a Principal Laboratory Research Scientist, Barbara used fluorescence microscopy, proximity biotinylation and mass spectrometry techniques to uncover novel host defence proteins co-operating in Toxoplasma control.",
      "Barbara is currently a postdoctoral research fellow working with Dr Eva Frickel at the IMI, University of Birmingham. Her research into innate host response to Toxoplasma is focused on infection in human retinal cells as a model for ocular toxoplasmosis."

      "Dr Coe’s research interests fall within the broad field of Media Law. A primary theme within his research agenda is the changing nature of journalism, and what this means, both normatively and theoretically, for free speech, press freedom and regulation. He is particularly interested in how the development of the internet, and the ascendancy of social media platforms, have altered the press industry and our media and communication ecology more broadly, and how this has led to significant transformative effects on the public sphere by changing the way we generate, publish, and consume information, and how we engage in public discourse generally. Dr Coe’s work in this area has led to him working with Impress, which is the Press Recognition Panel approved regulator of the UK press, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, on the development of their respective journalism codes. Upon invitation from the International Academy of Comparative Law and British Association of Comparative Law, in 2021-2022 he served as the UK’s National Rapporteur on Freedom of Speech and the Regulation of Fake News.",
      "A separate, albeit related, strand to his research agenda is defamation law and reputation, and more specifically, the protection of corporate reputation. His work on corporate reputation has been published in leading journals, including Legal Studies and the Journal of Business Law. Aspects of this research were cited by the Scottish Law Commission in its Discussion Paper on Defamation, ultimately informing its recommendations to continue allowing bodies trading for profit to sue in defamation.",
      "A combination of this research led to Dr Coe’s appointment by the Council of Europe as an independent member of the Council’s Expert Committee on Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. He has subsequently given expert evidence to the UK Government Justice Select Committee on SLAPPs and has advised and worked with the Ministry of Justice, charities, NGOs and other organisations on various reform proposals relating to this type of litigation."

      "Sophie is a biogeochemist working across aquatic landscapes, linking a continuum of ecosystems from streams and rivers to coastal wetlands and estuaries. Sophie specialises in carbon and nitrogen cycling and micro- and nanoplastic (MnP) pollution and is interested in the transport, processing and fate of carbon, nitrogen and plastic pollution with a particular focus on greenhouse gas dynamics. Carbon, nitrogen and plastic cycles are closely linked and may influence each other, for example, by providing substrate, affecting greenhouse gas fluxes and increasing microbial activity.",
      "Sophie’s motivation is to understand the major drivers of carbon, nitrogen and MnP dynamics in these systems as they relate to and continue to be affected by global change e.g. land-use, climate, increased pollution. Understanding how aquatic biogeochemistry will be affected by future global change has important consequences for meeting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, improving ecosystem health and protecting/improving ecosystem services for the future.",
      "Sophie’s research approach mixes in-situ measurements with manipulation experiments at micro- or mesocosm-scale so that drivers may be better understood through their investigation under controlled laboratory conditions and provide more understanding to what is observed in-situ at ecosystem scale. Through this work Sophie has used isotopic tracers to investigate whether the fate of nitrogen from denitrification in coastal wetlands is primarily as N2O or N2, including how this ratio changes under future global change, to determine whether greenhouse gas or harmless N2 is produced and investigated drivers of greenhouse gas fluxes from rivers and coastal wetlands.",

      "Laurence's core research interest is in the relationship between social identities and political institutions. His PhD research, which was undertaken in Birmingham's Department of Political Science and International Studies, explored the EU's approach to conflict resolution in the Western Balkans, and sought to explain the apparent preference of EU actors for consociational power-sharing mechanisms of managing conflict in deeply divided societies. The main outcome of this research was his first monograph, published as part of the Routledge Studies in European Foreign Policy series in 2019.",
      "From February 2017 to January 2019, Laurence worked on a postdoctoral project, funded by the ESRC Future Research Leaders scheme, which investigated the relationship between census politics and the design of power-sharing institutions, with a particular empirical focus on Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kenya, Lebanon and Northern Ireland. He is currently working on completing the last outputs from this project and from a further stream of research, funded by a British Academy/Leverhulme Small Research Grant, into the politics of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data collection through national censuses.",
      "He has recently started working on a new area of research, into how power-sharing shapes political responses to environmental crises in Northern Ireland, supported by a Birmingham Institute for Sustainability and Climate Action (BISCA) Sustainability Summer Internship."

Since then, and as Honorary Research Fellow of the Leopardi Centre at Birmingham, I have continued to devote my research to Leopardi and nineteenth-century literature and philosophy, while at the same time investigating this period as the matrix of many epistemological questions which would become fully manifest in the Novecento and beyond, and which still inform our contemporary sensitivity. From the perspective of language pedagogy, I am also interested in exploring the way new attention ecology  theories can enhance the theory and practice of second language acquisition."

      "My research interests focus on socio-political history of the Roman Republic and Empire, with a particular interest in the nature of Roman imperialism, and Roman attitudes towards their position as a political power in the Mediterranean.",
      "My first book, Pax and the Politics of Peace (OUP, 2017), examines the two generations that spanned the collapse of the Republic and the Augustan period in order to understand how the concept of pax Romana, as a central ideology of Roman imperialism, evolved. I argue for the integral nature of pax in understanding the changing dynamics of the Roman state through civil war to the creation of a new political system and world-rule. Roman discourses on peace were part of the wider discussion on the way in which Rome conceptualized her Empire and ideas of imperialism. I have also published papers on the role of peace-makers and heralds in Roman literary accounts of conflict in terms of what this reveals about Roman attitudes to war and peace, and have numerous papers on the Roman civil wars, from the framing of enemies through language, to internal negotiation and diplomacy during civil conflict and the development of imperial values and iconography. I am also currently co-editing a volume on ‘Rediscovering the Roman Civil Wars of 49-30 BCE: New Approaches, New Evidence’, and am part of a German Research Network, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which explores the topic of ‘Internal War: Society, Social Order and Political Conflict in Antiquity’ (April 2018-March 2021).",
      "Besides a specific focus on the language of peace and civil war, I have also published on the reactions to Roman imperialism, examining the geo-political situation of the western Alps under Augustus, and the elite response to imperial power.",
      "I held a three year Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship (2016-2018), which examined the production of space as a means of understanding diplomacy as a social practice in the Roman world. This study focuses on the architectural and urban spaces of the city of Rome as a site of diplomatic practice, in order to examine the social interactions through which Rome, as a political entity, communicated and maintained its position in the Mediterranean.",
      "I have been invited to present on my research a number of International conferences and research seminars, as well as public lectures and events, including the closing ceremony of the 2016 Being Human Festival at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. I am also contributed to a number of episodes for a BBC Radio 4 history programme (When Greeks Flew Kites) and contributed to the BBC History Magazine."

I am especially interested in combining data-driven approaches with conceptual insight from frameworks outside conventional disciplinary boundaries. My work is concerned both with testing the predictions and orthodoxies of theoretical linguistics as well as with challenging the ideological assumptions that underpin the public, policy and scholarly discourses that affect the social and material conditions of language users."

      "My scholarship centres on the literature and culture of New York City, queer writing, and American poetry.",
      "My first book was entitled Collage in Twentieth-Century Art, Literature, and Culture: Joseph Cornell, William Burroughs, Frank O’Hara, and Bob Dylan (Ashgate, 2014). Exploring the influence of Europe’s artist-émigrés on New York City culture from 1912 onwards, it argued that collage was both a transformative practice and a provocative theoretical model that was central to modernism and its aftermaths, revolutionizing the ways in which literature was written and art and music was made during the twentieth century.",
      "I am currently writing my second monograph, Everyday Rebellion: New York City Poetry After 1950 (under contract to Louisiana State University Press, 2025).  Everyday Rebellion asks: how can poetic forms challenge structural oppression? How does poetry engage with forms of discrimination? To what extent can poets change the world through language? Taking as its exemplars a range of poetry published in New York between 1950-1995, it explores the possibilities and parameters of poetic resistance. In doing so, it both offers a comprehensive study of New York’s poetry and poetic voices, and illuminates the quiet heroism and long history of hopeful struggle inherent in dissident poems and voices, providing a contemporary model for everyday rebellion, dissident reading, and alternate world-building in the 21st century.",
      "I am also the editor, with Yasmine Shamma, of Conversations with New York School Poets (under contract with Edinburgh University Press, 2025). In this collection, twenty-five New York School poets explore and define the milieu they wrote from, and shed light on their journeys through New York and through poetry. Collected over a three-year period, these fascinating conversations tackle, reframe, and probe the question of what constitutes the New York School.",
      "My first poetry collection, a lyric memoir about my sister, called I Remember Kim, was published in 2023, with Verve Poetry Press. I am currently working on a new poetic project, Shadows and Benedictions: a personal history of sharks.",
      "In 2020 I was awarded an AHRC Research Networking Grant for the project Creating the Network for New York School Studies. The project has created an official global Network designed to offer scholars, poets, creative organizations, and members of the public an intellectual and creative community within the wide and growing field of New York School studies. In 2018 I was awarded a British Academy Small Grant (2018-2020) for the digital humanities project Joe Brainard and the New York School: Material Texts and Digital Cultures (or 'Make Your Own Brainard'), which has put the work of New York School artist and poet Joe Brainard into dialogue with digital media and digital media users via an interactive website (Make Your Own Brainard) and examines questions about hegemonic narratives surrounding academic impact, funding for the arts, and the digital humanities.",
      "I have written articles and chapters (published and forthcoming) on Bob Dylan in the 1980s, Frank O'Hara and the New York School, Allen Ginsberg and queer sexuality, John Ashbery's queer poetics of the HIV/AIDS crisis, Black queer kinship and the poetry of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, teaching Bernadette Mayer, teaching the mimeograph revolution, the ecopoetics of Anne Waldman's Life Notes, Joe Brainard and queer optimism, New York poetry, American women poet-editors and the mimeograph revolution, Joe Brainard and John Ashbery, Allen Ginsberg and Frank O’Hara, Allen Ginsberg and collage, place, space and identity in Richard Yates, William Burroughs, affect, and taste, and William Burroughs and art."

      "I am researching a history of homeless in modern Britain from the 1880s to modern day. This includes recreating the life stories of vagrants in late Victorian times; exploring the hidden history of the mass squatting of military camps in 1946; examining the role of the Reception Centres after 1946; and considering the impact of organisations, such as Shelter and Crisis, in campaigning for the homeless.",

      "This project was funded by the Leverhulme Trust, and and was undertaken with my colleague Matthew Hilton. NGOs have raised new political agendas, transformed and revived associational life, re-politicised generations seemingly disillusioned with the politics of the ballot box and inspired numerous pieces of legislation and regulatory initiatives. By mapping the sector, examining its role and interpreting its power, this research will provide a better assessment of the role of NGOs in contemporary Britain as well as contributing to current policy and interdisciplinary academic debates regarding civil society, voluntarism and associational life, state-NGO relations and the role of the ‘third sector’ more generally. Two books have arisen from the project A Historical Guide to NGOs in Britain: Charities, Civil Society and the Voluntary Sector since 1945 (Palgrave, 2012) and The Politics of Expertise (Oxford University Press, forthcoming 2013).",
      "With an AHRC Resource Enhancement Grant  I, along with Matthew Hilton, created the Database on the Archives of UK Non-Governmental Organisations since 1945 (DANGO) This is a research tool to enable researchers to identify the archives of NGOs.",

      "I am a cultural, literary, and intellectual historian of medieval and early modern Iran, the Ottoman Empire and Central Asia. My research straddles the larger Persianate and Turkic worlds of the medieval and early modern eras, exploring the political, cultural, and social role of Muslim Turkic/Turkish (Ottoman, Chaghatay, Azerbaijani) literary traditions against their Persian and Arabic backgrounds. Relying on primary sources in all these languages and having an equal footing in Iranian, Ottoman, and Central Asian history, I study empire, cosmopolitanism, religious and ethnic identities, and processes of confessionalisation and vernacularisation in the late medieval and early modern periods. I am also interested in comparative and network-based approaches to global history, combining literary, intellectual, and cultural history, as well as historical sociolinguistics, while also asking questions relevant to social and religious history.",
      "I am currently completing two monographic projects. Titled Sons of Japheth and Ali: Turkic Language and Ideology in Medieval and Early Modern Iran, the first book focuses on the relationship between literary language and political theology in medieval and early modern Islamic empires. Based on multilingual manuscripts, it explores how the Safavid, Ottoman and Mughal empires, as well as the Uzbek Khanates of Central Asia, all came from the same tribal matrix of the post-Mongol world but developed entirely different confessional, linguistic, and social arrangements in the early modern period, Iran becoming Shii and Persophone, while the Ottoman Empire and most of Central Asia Sunni and Turkophone. My second book project, tentatively titled Pen, Sword and Brush: Sadiqi Beg (1533-1610) and Self-Fashioning in Early Modern Iran, is an intellectual biography of a prominent but neglected bilingual poet and painter in Safavid Iran against the background of contemporary sea changes in patronage, literary and pictorial taste, as well as religious outlook and political centralisation."

      "My research covers the period of the long eighteenth-century, roughly 1680-1830. I am interested particularly in prose style of the period, including prose fiction and the novel but also ephemeral or marginal forms of writing, especially ones that blur the boundary between fact and fiction and public and private, as diaries and letters often do. I am a specialist on eighteenth-century literary letters and archives; as well as a monograph on the epistolary novelist Samuel Richardson and an edition of his correspondence, I have recently written articles on Defoe and Swift as letter-writers.",
      "Samuel Richardson’s Letters: Monograph and Edition",
      "My first book, Samuel Richardson and the Art of Letter-Writing (Cambridge University Press, 2016), examined the links between the novelist’s correspondence, his epistolary novels, and the shaping of his authorial career. As a result of this work, I have recently co-edited (along with George Justice and Sören Hammerschmidt) Richardson’s Correspondence Primarily on Pamela and Clarissa (1732-1749) for Cambridge University Press, which is volume 9 of The Cambridge Edition of the Correspondence of Samuel Richardson, the first full scholarly edition of his letters.",
      "Letters, Letter-Writing, and Epistolary Novels",
      "I’m currently working on a book which studies the history of literary letter-writing in the period after Alexander Pope’s authorized publication of his correspondence in 1737 until the Romantic era; it’s provisionally entitled The Making of Letters as Literature: 1737-1830. In it I will explore Pope’s influence on concepts of epistolary fame through a series of case studies of letters archives from Swift to Byron, as well as other lesser-known writers.",
      "I enjoy talking and writing about eighteenth-century fiction for public and expert audiences alike. I have written for the British Library on the history of letters both in fiction and as shaping authorial reputation. I have also recently completed an Oxford Bibliography on ‘The Eighteenth-Century Novel’, an annotated guide to criticism in this area, which can be found online.",
      "OUP Edition of Alexander Pope’s letters",
      "Aside from my second monograph, I am also currently involved in a new edition of Alexander Pope’s letters to be published as part of The Oxford Edition of the Writings of Alexander Pope. This edition aims to supplant older versions to become the new standard scholarly version of Pope’s letters.",
      "Satire",
      "I have a longstanding interest in the forms of satire that eighteenth-century writers work with and against and am especially interested in the way authors are both inspired by and break away from classical precedent. I have considered the way women writers use a form associated with public address and controversial proclamation to their own (sometimes quieter) literary effect in an essay on satire and portraiture for the Oxford Handbook of Eighteenth-Century Satire."

This work has developed into a broader concern with philosophical approaches to meaning and ways of rethinking music’s place within networks of psychological, social and historical forces.",
      "My work on musical meaning has shaded into the study of music analysis and much of my work in this area has concerned late eighteenth-century music. I have produced more thoroughly analytical research on the patterns and practices of blues music. In this work I have adapted recent analytical technologies to bring new light to the blues while attempting to remain sensitive to the complex socio-cultural contexts that articulate this fascinating body of music."

      "My research is focused around three main themes:",
      "1. Formulaic language",
      "I am interested in the role that lexically specific units (fixed phrases and frames with slots that can be filled with novel lexical material) play in first language acquisition as well as adult production and comprehension. In a series of studies based on various child corpora, I show that children's grammatical knowledge is best captured by means of such units, that the units can be derived from the input that children are exposed to, and that children become syntactically productive as they generalize over lexically specific units which share both formal and semantic characteristics. In another project (funded by the AHRC), which combined corpus and experimental methods, I argue that this also applies to complex syntactic constructions such as questions with long distance dependencies. This is important because most syntacticians believe that such constructions require complex syntactic machinery built on linguistically specific innate representations.",
      "In more recent work, I have argued that adult informal conversational speech is also based on lexically specific units and the psychological reality, or otherwise, of corpus-based measures of collocation strength. My current research in this area explores collocations as an area of particular difficulty for second language learners and the role of collocational information in acquiring word meaning.",
      "2. The nature of linguistic generalizations",
      "A number of studies, including some of my own, have argued that syntactic productivity relies on stitching together stored chunks. I have also shown that learners don't necessarily represent generalizations that are demonstrably present in their language. This tension between linguists' descriptions (driven by principles of economy) and what speakers know about the grammar of their language (formulas and low-scope patterns) raises some interesting questions: How do speakers manage to behave as if they have extracted a generalization when in fact they haven't? Even more puzzlingly, how did the patterns come into being, how do they survive, and what is their ontological status? This, and the research on individual differences described below, has led me to the realization that languages belong to communities, not individuals: that is to say, individual speakers “own” only parts of their language and a new interest in the social and cultural processes that shape language, and how they interact with cognitive processes – something which I would like to pursue in future research.",
      "3. Individual differences in linguistic knowledge",
      "Most linguists assume, either implicitly or explicitly, that all native speakers of a language converge on (more or less) the same grammar. In a series of studies I demonstrated that is not the case: there are, in fact, considerable individual differences in speakers' knowledge of various areas of grammar, including quantifiers, passives, subordination, and some aspects of inflectional morphology. Many, though not all, of these differences are education-related. Those that are all show a characteristic pattern: highly educated speakers perform at or near ceiling, while less educated speakers show vast individual differences, with performance ranging from ceiling to chance (and sometimes below chance).",
      "While most of my early work was devoted to demonstrating the reality of individual differences, in more recent projects I focus on exploring their causes. I have also expanded my interests to comparing native speakers and adult L2 learners, and examining differences in grammatical knowledge in the context of speakers' knowledge of vocabulary and collocational patterns."

      "My current research is on ‘Sexual violence against women in Algeria: narratives, translations, languages'.  The project firstly aims to contribute to the study complex intersection between language, translation studies and literature related to violence in contemporary Algeria. The project’s output will be a monograph, bridging the gap of knowledge between literature in Arabic and in French, highlighting the role of translation in understanding discourses.  Secondly, it investigates why colonial violence against Algerian women in the Liberation War is relatively well researched compared with terrorist violence committed in the 1990s, which remains understudied.  The monograph investigates narratives of lived trauma translated through various mediums (novels, testimonies, memoirs and personal interviews of survivors) and through languages (French, Arabic) and in translations. Sexual violence in wartime (Community on Facebook)",

      "The project builds on my research on language and power and their relations to gender discourses in the MENA region in general. It investigates the relationship between language, literature, translation and cultural memory on sexual violence against women in conflict in Algeria and how this violence is translated through various mediums (novels, testimonies, memoirs and interviews of survivors), across languages (French, Arabic) and in translations.  I organised an international conference at the University of Birmingham in 2014 on the theme of ‘Narrating and Translating Sexual Violence at wartime in the MENA region’.",
      "My research on language and power was on the emergence of new variety of Arabic which I call e-Arabic as a result of globalisation.  After exhausting the topic, I became particularly interested in a new genre of writing that is emerging out of blogs, emails…etc.; making its way into Arabic literature despite the controversy it is creating.  An example of these ‘novels’ are Banat Al Riyadh (2005) and Ayza Atjawiz (2008). (For more information see my blog: http://earaby.blogspot.co.uk/).  I organised International Conferences on the theme for example one at the University of Durham: “Cyber space and minorities/oppositional voices in the Arab world”. I collaboratively with Professor Abdeljalikl Temimi organized an International conference in Tunisia (Foundation Temimi, Tunis, Tunisia) on “The Internet and the Arabic Language”. I published extensively on the concept of e-Arabic and gave papers at various conferences and symposia.",
      "My first monograph is published with Peter Lang, entitled Cultural and Linguistic Encounters: Arab EFL Learners Encoding and Decoding Idioms, in which I study idioms and their translations into English by Arab EFL learners, with a particular reference to bilingual dictionaries (Arabic-English-Arabic)."

      "Amber’s doctoral thesis examined legal and ethical frameworks that regulate decision-making about children and explored literature on understanding and interpreting parents’ motivations for their child’s participation in medical research. The thesis analysed the extent to which ethics of care theory can improve understanding and interpretation of parents’ motivations for research participation, with focus on children in the context of their caring relationships and responsibilities within relationships.",
      "Amber has conducted research on partnerships between health and law to better identify the needs of children and families, and understanding social determinants of health in different regions. As a Visiting Fellow at New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG), Amber shadowed attorneys working in public and private hospital law clinics to inform this research. Amber was introduced to NYLAG as a Visiting Scholar at Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics and the Hastings Center.",
      "Amber has previously received a small funding award from the University of Liverpool International Network Fund for a project on child health and wellbeing in a developing country. Amber has also organised a series of interdisciplinary seminars on the regulation of decision-making about children’s health, funded by the University of Liverpool Global Health Funding.",
      "More recently, Amber is conducting research on the use of do-it-yourself artificial pancreas systems (DIY APS) for children and young people living with type one diabetes, looking specifically at parental responsibility and best interests decision-making."

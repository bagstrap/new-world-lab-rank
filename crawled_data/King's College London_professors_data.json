      "My work examines the use of imagery of the maritime world and the maritime cultural landscape alongside physical interactions with this scape in the process of Identity creation and engagement by Victorians and Edwardians. Situated within the Maritime turn of the humanities as well as New Thalassology, this research illuminates the landlocked nature of national identity research for Britain and England along with demonstrating relational interactions between England and the maritime cultural landscape in identity work.",
      "The sea’s unique characteristics as a scape, which stems from the very nature of the scape, has often been the cause of its silencing in research from a range of fields, makes it a potent and highly variable space for Victorian and Edwardians to engaged in banal national relationships affirming and developing their sense of identity."

      "Dr Abbate’s research focuses on the development of chemical approaches for biomedical and toxicological applications. This is advanced by his background in synthetic chemistry and analytical science, as well as by his extensive network of national and international collaborators. Key collaborators include the Imaging Chemistry and Biology team at KCL, the Clinical Toxicology and the Urology units at GSTT, the University of Bath, The University of Naples, TicTac Communications Ltd and Theragnostics Ltd.",
      "Dr Abbate’s research is multi- and inter-disciplinary. His expertise is in Analytical Toxicology and his research supports two critical themes in the field:",
      "- the design of metal chelators for both medical and diagnostic applications.",
      "- the development of new analytical approaches and the discovery of new biomarkers for New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) and other misused substances.",
      "Current Projects include:",
      "a) Metal chelators design: The team has developed for the first time a range of peptide-based iron-sensitive fluorescent probes for the monitoring and adjustment of mitochondrial levels of labile iron pool (LIP). High concentration of LIP causes oxidative stress and cellular toxicity, leading to diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases, which are among the ten top causes of death globally. This research line has been supported by the BBSRC and, more recently, by Parkinson’s UK.",
      "The expertise in chelator development further extends to the area of nuclear medicine, which forms the basis of an interdisciplinary research programme. In collaboration with the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, we recently collaborated towards the design of a novel PET tracer for prostate cancer detection. A close collaboration for the past five years with an industrial partner (Theragnostics LTD) has allowed the translation of preclinical findings in clinical practice. Further support for this research has been obtained through MRC funding (research grants and PhD case studentships).",
      "b) NPS: Dr Abbate chairs an IUPAC international committee on New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) (link) which received funding to review the landscape of these emerging designer drugs at the international level. Dr Abbate leads a research group within King’s Forensics where he currently supervise a number of fully-funded PhD students working in the field of NPS: these include a BBSRC-iCASE funded project on mephedrone administration in healthy volunteers; a PhD studentship investigating novel metabolite detection of synthetic cannabinoids, a PhD project investigating novel emerging synthetic cathinones; and a PhD project evaluating the on-site rapid detection of NPS using portable instruments (in collaboration with TicTac Communications).",
      "c) Improved detection of peptide hormones in drug testing: We are currently developing improved analytical methods for the detection of misused peptide hormones including growth-hormone releasing hormone-synthetic analogues, insulin-synthetic analogues and their metabolites in biological matrices. The team has also extensive expertise in the design and synthesis of synthetic peptides."

      "Our chief interest is the ‘multi-tasking’ blood-brain barrier (BBB). The brain capillary endothelium forming the BBB regulates molecular traffic between blood and brain, and protects the brain from potentially harmful substances circulating in the blood. Understanding the complexity of BBB physiology helps in the design of modern CNS drug therapies. Many neuropathologies involve BBB breakdown or dysfunction – treating the barrier could help reduce the severity of neurodegeneration and aid repair.",
      "Developing good in vitro models of the BBB",
      "We have optimised several cell culture models of the brain endothelium that permit study of a range of functional activities of the BBB, and may have applications in screening drugs for permeability across the BBB.",
      "Transport functions of the BBB and flow of interstitial fluid",
      "The BBB has uptake and efflux carriers mediating bi-directional molecular transport. We are examining transporters that could be used to deliver drugs to the brain, and others (efflux transporters) that impede drug entry. We are also studying BBB ion transport, and its key role in the formation and regulation of brain interstitial fluid (ISF). We are mapping the routes for ISF flow, with application in programmes designed to deliver therapeutic agents to the brain. Disturbances of ISF production and flow may be involved in several brain disorders including stroke and tumours.",
      "Cell:cell signalling at the BBB",
      "The ‘BBB phenotype’ develops in brain endothelium under the inductive influence of closely associated cell types, especially astrocytic glial cells. The mature BBB appears to be modulated physiologically by signals from glia and neurons, and possibly other cell types, allowing coordination of the ‘neurovascular unit’. We are using cell culture models and fluorescence imaging to determine the receptors present, and their role in cell:cell signalling. Many of the endothelial receptors we have identified cause a rise in intracellular calcium – a possible first step in signal transduction pathways by which glial cells (and neurons) could influence endothelial physiology (tightness, transport function, metabolism).",

      "We have a number of collaborative projects on the role of BBB dysfunction in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis. The aim is to understand the mechanisms by which the barrier may be impaired, and the implications for the neurological condition. We are also exploring therapeutic strategies that may reduce BBB damage and hence limit the severity of brain disorders.",
      "Drug delivery across the BBB",
      "By careful examination of the routes for molecular movement across the BBB we are developing ‘predictive rules’ to guide the design of drug compounds to target or avoid the brain. So far this works best for lipid soluble compounds passively diffusing across the endothelial lipid membranes. The next step will be to incorporate understanding of uptake and efflux transporter function. We are also working on novel methods for delivering ‘problem drugs’ (large or polar molecules) including use of nanoparticle delivery systems, and transient opening of the BBB. Our successful ‘BBB Consortium with Industry’ is now operating in ‘Club’ mode: organising meetings, advising on new developments, and setting up joint research projects (enquiries welcome)"

      "Mary Adams is a social anthropologist and registered midwife.  Her research interests are the anthropology of health and social care policy and of medicine, in Southern Africa and in the UK.   Her ESRC funded PhD (UCL/Kent, 2007) and post-doctoral work examined the social and epistemic effects of health and social reform initiatives on inter-generational migrant communities in the peri-urban areas of Harare, Zimbabwe (see JRAI 15,4,2009; MAQ 2010; Children’s Geographies 7,2,2009).  After several years working as a lecturer in anthropology and medical anthropology (Goldsmiths, UCL, Kent, Christ Church University College)  she began full-time research at the National Nursing Research Unit (KCL) focusing on critical perspectives on NHS policy on staff wellbeing and patient experiences of health care (see Health:2012;  IJOPN 2012; BMJ Open 2013; Health 2017; JHSRP 2017).  In September 2012 she joined the NIHR BRC at KCL on a two-year “Social Science of Engagement” Fellowship, examining contemporary intersections between clinical care and clinical research from the perspectives of NHS patients and research teams (see Medical Anthropology 2014; JHSRP 2015; Sociology 2016),  Since 2016 she has been a King's Improvement Science Fellow, focusing her research on organisational responses to women and families harmed in maternity care."

      "My research interests concentrate on the development of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's intellectual legacy in Britain and America, 1834-1934. Alongside Coleridge's later works, however, this includes a large number of areas. Some of these are Romantic and Victorian poetry, the Aesthetic Movement, Practical Criticism and CambridgeEnglish, American Transcendentalism, Pragmatism (especially John Dewey), American Liberal Protestant theology, British Idealism, and Nineteenth Century British Political Thought. Additionally, my thesis examines education reform (particularly of the American College degree), the developement of theology and philosophy in Cambridge in the Nineteenth Century, the Metaphysical Society, and the Camridge Apostles.",
      "Plans for future research projects include a renewed critical heritage, concentrating on Coleridge's reception in the nineteenth century; a study of Coleridge's intellectual impact in the long nineteenth century; a history of education reforms in America in the nineenth century  and a metabiography of Coleridge."

The project uses both data analysis that captures national and regional level evidence, and social interviews that learn from people’s personal experiences and insights of mental health problems in contemporary multicultural Britain.",
      "The quantitative phase looks at trends in prevalence and treatment access for common mental disorders in people from ethnic minority backgrounds in England between 1993-2014. This uses data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys, the longest running nationally representative household survey series for mental health and wellbeing in the UK.",
      "The qualitative phase seeks to interview participants from ethnic minority backgrounds who have agreed to share their experiences and perceptions of mental health problems and care, to answer questions that cannot be analysed from existing data.",

This research is an endeavour to bridge the gap between drug delivery and pharmaceutical technology on one hand and new design and production methods such as 3D printing on the other hand. The goal of this effort is to break current boundaries of oral drug delivery systems and formulation design and to link pharmacy to an increasingly smart and digitally connected environment of this age. This effort can enable the digitalisation of dosage form design and prototyping, innovation of new drug delivery systems that are responsive to biosensors and environmental changes as well as improving the personalisation of dosage forms.",
      "His fundamental research has led to several world firsts; first example of using pharmaceutical grade polymers in FDM 3D printing, first 3D printed tablets to meet the US and British Pharmacopoeias for delayed release products, and first examples of 3D printing of liquid capsule. He introduced and patented the innovative concept of tablets of complex architecture as a solution for fast disintegration and dissolution. Mohamed is working with industrial and clinical partners on the manufacturing of 3D printed dosage forms. He is also collaborating with two global manufacturers of pharmaceutical coating on the scale-up and commercialising a next generation of coating solution of nutraceutical products.",

      "I aim to conduct an ethnographic and historical project examining the folkloric industry in Iraq as a tool for upholding nation-state narratives in the 1980s. As an entry point, I will look at marginalised dance forms in southern Iraq which are especially stratified along gendered, classed, racial and ethnic lines. Although there is a lack of official archives on such dances, YouTube holds “unofficial” archives dating back to the 80s when there was a heavier investment in cultural production. I aim to trace the various power dynamics that stratify these forms of “unofficial” representation and look at structures being reproduced/dismantled."

She holds a MSc in Medical Humanities (2018), and a BA in English Language and Linguistics (2016) from King's College London. Maxine's research examines the intersections between language, culture and health. In particular, she is interested in discursive constructions of identity and embodiment within illness narrative and pathography, digital health and wellness cultures and public health communicative practices. Primarily drawing on critical feminist analytic approaches, Maxine’s work seeks to demystify the interrelationships of gender, power and ideology in health discourses."

      "My research centres on developing algorithms for analysing medical images of the brain such as MR data. The main goal is to characterise salient features of the anatomy and the development or degeneration of the brain. I am interested in combining the established and fundamental tools of medical image processing, such as registration and anatomical segmentation, with machine learning methods in order to develop novel methodologies for group and longitudinal studies using MR data sets. The ultimate aim of such studies is to provide population-level representations that are relevant to clinical and neuroscientific hypotheses. In particular, I am keen on finding out how fundamental medical image processing methods may be informed by, as well as help create, population-level representations."

      "The neurobiology of Ultra High-Risk (UHR) states for psychosis",
      "Since completing my PhD and post-doctoral work my research work has mainly focused on studies of individuals with an Ultra Hight Risk for psychosis (who exhibit early signs and symptoms of psychotic illness). By integrating different neurocognitive and neuroimaging techniques, and working closely with our associated clinical service (Outreach and Support in South London; OASIS), the aim of this research is to establish predictive factors conferring elevated risk for development of psychotic illness in UHR individuals. In particular, I have been at the forefront of a multimodal neuroimaging programme that aims to characterise neuropathology associated with psychosis at anatomical, physiological and neurochemical levels. This work has led to several peer review publications, oral presentation invites and successful funding applications. In particular, my work in this area has attracted prestigious funding awards form the Brain and Behaviour Research Foundation (formally NARSAD). The 2010 NARSAD Independent Investigator Award was one of only 49 awarded globally from over 800 application.",
      "Neurocognitive basis of auditory verbal hallucinations",
      "The focus of my doctoral and post-doctoral work, I have used functional neuroimaging and cognitive psychological techniques to study clinical and non-clinical subjects who are prone to hallucinations. This work has led to a number of peer review publications that have been cited over 350 times. Recently I was invited to contribute to a special edition of Schizophrenia Bulletin on this topic  (http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/current) and I am a founding member of the International Consortium of Hallucination Research (http://hallucinationconsortium.org/). I have been also written three book chapters on auditory hallucinations.",
      "The acute neurocognitive effects of cannabis",
      "Using neuroimaging the aim of this work is to examine the effects of acute Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) administration (active compounds of the cannabis plant) on cognition and associated neurofunction. I have published 6 papers on this topic in international peer reviewed journals and in 2009 our group's work was the subject of a television documentary programme (Horizon, British Broadcasting Corporation). I am currently involved in a study investigating the potential use of CBD as a treatment for people with an UHR for psychosis funded by the Guy's and St Thomas Challenge Fund UK. It is hoped that this work will lead to more effective, specific and safer early interventions in people with early signs and symptoms of psychosis."

      "I'm interested in how early medieval textual and material cultural productions have been translated, reinterpreted, and represented in 20th and 21st century texts, visual art and performance, and heritage organisations. My research asks what sort of identities and communities the medieval is called upon to create today, and why and how those interested in the study of literature might engage with new, multimedia, interdisciplinary productions.",
      "My thesis, examined in February 2020 by Catherine Karkov and Andrew Elliott, examines the public life of Sutton Hoo, with a particular focus on the use of Old English poetry (including Beowulf and the Rune Poem) in its presentations. I analyse newspaper coverage of the 1939 discovery, television documentaries across the 20th century, and museum-based displays and performances (considering script, movement, and landscape), to demonstrate the ways in which meanings of the early medieval past are bound up in local and national identity-making practices and a variety of political ideologies."

      "I'm interested in the materials-related issues in view of various nuclear power plant applications. For light water reactors, researches are focused on mechanisms of stress corrosion cracking and environmental fatigue of austenitic alloys in high temperature water. Also, recently. I developed high strength (YS ~ 1GPa) alumina-forming duplex stainless steels (ADSS) for the accident tolerant fuel cladding materials and radiation-resistant austenitic stainless steels (ARES) for nuclear applications. For generation-IV reactors, the effects of high temperature environments (helium, steam, hydrogenated steam, supercritical-CO2) on microstructure and mechanical properties are investigated. Metallic materials with high strength and oxidation resistance in those environments are of main interest. Recent activities include the development of alloys with excellent corrosion resistance in Cl-based molten salt reactors."
